# GoTorrent

## Description
A command line interface written in Go for torrenting via the BitTorrent protocol.

## Motivation
I began this project to learn Go through building a non trivial project. Distributed networking is interesting to me and I enjoyed learning about peer to peer torrenting in school.

## Quick Start
Building the project when inside the project root directory is done using the command: go build -o bin/gotorrent

## Usage
Inside the project root directory after building the project you can run the project using the command: ./bin/gotorrent path/to/.../example.torrent
